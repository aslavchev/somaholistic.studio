# Contributing

## Quick Start
```bash
fork → clone → `npm install` → `npm run dev` → code → test → commit → PR
```

## Commit Convention
```
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation
style: formatting
refactor: code restructure
perf: performance
test: tests
chore: maintenance
```

## PR Process
1. Branch from `main`
2. Keep changes focused
3. Update tests
4. Run `npm run build` (must pass)
5. Use conventional commits

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint rules enforced
- Functional components only
- Props typed with interfaces
