---

---

## What Needs Fixing

### 1. "See More" Button Doesn't Work on Computers

**The Problem:**
When visitors use a computer (not phone), they see "Виж повече ↓" text on service cards, but clicking it does nothing. They can't see the benefits list or "suitable for" information.

**Why It Matters:**
Many clients browse on desktop computers, especially during work. They miss important information that could convince them to book.

**The Fix:**
Make the button clickable on all devices, not just phones.

---

### 2. Security Improvement Needed

**The Problem:**
The booking form sends customer information to WhatsApp without cleaning it first.

**Why It Matters:**
While unlikely, someone could potentially misuse this. It's a standard safety measure for all professional websites.

**The Fix:**
Add automatic cleaning of form data before sending.

---

### 3. Google Maps Not Connected

**The Problem:**
Your website doesn't link to your Google Maps listing where you already have great reviews.

**Why It Matters:**
- Clients can't easily get directions
- Your real Google rating isn't shown
- Missed opportunity to build trust with real reviews

**The Fix:**
Add "See on Google Maps" link and show your actual Google rating (instead of made-up numbers).

---

### 4. Google Can't Understand Your Business

**The Problem:**
Your website doesn't have special code that tells Google what your business is, where it's located, what services you offer, etc.

**Why It Matters:**
- Lower ranking in Google search results
- No rich information shown in search (like star ratings, address, hours)
- Harder for new clients to find you

**The Fix:**
Add structured data that Google uses to understand businesses.

---

## Booking Flow Improvements

### Phone Number Input
**Current:** Users must type full number including +359
**New:**
- "+" is already shown
- Country code dropdown (Bulgaria default)
- User only types their number
- **Auto-formats as they type:** 888 → 888 3 → 888 33 → 888 333 → 888 333 4...
- Shows: `888 333 424` (with spaces for easy reading)
- Mobile phones can autofill from contacts

**Why this is better:**
- Easier to read and verify
- Users can spot typos immediately
- Looks professional

### Confirmation Process
**How it will work:**
1. Client fills booking form on website
2. Client sends message via WhatsApp
3. **You reply in WhatsApp within 2 hours** to confirm
4. Client sees confirmation in same chat

**Client sees this message after booking:**
> "След изпращане на заявката ще получите потвърждение в WhatsApp до 2 часа. Моля, проверете съобщенията си."

**Suggested confirmation template for you:**
```
✅ Потвърдено!

Дата: [дата]
Час: [час]
Услуга: [услуга]

Адрес: ул. 409-та 13, Манастирски Ливади

Очаквам ви! 🙏
